After reading about [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) I decided to give it a go
and leave the hand made pages behind.

To be honest, I first considered [Ghost](https://ghost.org) and gave that a
quick spin. Although I really enjoyed Ghosts editor I really dislike the
dependencies it put on my server, and why generate the same pages over and
over again?


## Why hugo them?

With Hugo, the site is generated from Markdown to static HTML ridiculously
fast (we're talking microseconds here). It has one dependency (hugo itself).
It works on Windows as well as Mac. It uses Markdown.

And, the fact that it is implemented in go and open source does not hurt.


## A few hours

Setting up a basic site and creating a theme was only a matter of a few hours.
The [Hugo Quickstart](http://hugo.spf13.com/overview/quickstart) is basically
what you need to read, then your good to start publishing.

The theme for this site is [liquorice](http://github.com/eliasson/liquorice),
a theme I made myself and made available under the MIT license. I'll try write
another post on that topic, meanwhile feel free to download the theme at
[github](http://github.com/eliasson/liquorice)
