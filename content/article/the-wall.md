I would say that the biggest obstacle in most organizations is the distance between business and IT departments. Sometimes it is like two different worlds, where many avoid collaboration all together and others collaborate under the strict supervision of processes.

Not only is the border between them fictive, it is also stupid. Having a barrier between those who build the software and those who use it is without a doubt the most efficient way to guarantee suboptimal software.

All my successful projects have been executed in tight collaboration between business and developers. I remember one situation in particular where the organizational structure and existing processes were completely short circuited by the business people. They declared a secret project that required additional NDA for insight (read interference) and put all involved people in the same room for a few months. It was a success.

I still do not understand why IT and business are separated, at all. Software is not there to support the business, it is the business! While the people working with processes and collaboration between these two groups most often have good intentions, it is contra-productive. These groups should not be separated, it should be one - us.

Accelerate your business by combining experts on the business domain with experts on software and let them work without friction.

- Assume that the other side wants well
- Mutual understanding of what needs to be done is a must
- Remove any boundaries between business and IT

# You decide, no one else

There was nothing revolutionary about this series of articles, no panacea. It intends to serve as a reminder that you do not have to do what everyone else is doing. Or even worse, what they tell you that you must do.

Take a look around, what obstacles do you see? All those obstacles are there because you allow them to be there, and no one but you will remove them. It might feel daunting to change your internal way of working - but the first step is to realize that there are very few rules you have to follow, the rest is up to you.

To summarize:
- Keep things small and simple
- Use test-driven development and pair-programming 
- Do not be afraid to release, be afraid to not release
- Do everything in your power to have your experts collaborate
